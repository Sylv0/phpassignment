I mixed in some praying mantis DNA. You know a praying mantis is the exact opposite of a vole, Morty? They mate once and then bluergh cut each other's heads off. Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it.
    Rubber baby buggy bumpers! Hi! I'm Mr Meeseeks! Look at me! You don't have to try to impress me Morty. Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck those people, fuck this whole thing Ethan.",    //string
